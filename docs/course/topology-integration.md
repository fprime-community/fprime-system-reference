# IMU Exercise: Topology Integration and Testing

The next step in developing our component is to add our component into the system's topology, building it for the RPI,
and running the final code.

## Topology Integration

In order to see how a component is integrated into topology, we can look through two files in the `Top` folder. These
files are `Top/topology.fpp` for the connections and `Top/instances.fpp` used for instantiating components. **Note:**
these connections are already in-place as we are working in the system reference.  You may delete and recreate them or
survey what is present.

In the topology file (`Top/topology.fpp`) we add two instances `imu` and `imuI2cBus`. The first is our `Imu` component
and the second is the `imuI2cBus`, which is an instantiation of our `LinuxI2cDriver`.

```fpp
module SystemReference {
  ...
  
  topology SystemReference {
    ...
    instance imu
    instance imuI2cBus
    ...

    connections I2c {
        imu.read -> imuI2cBus.read
        imu.write -> imuI2cBus.write
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

These instantiations are found in `Top/instances.fpp` where we control the setup of the components. The relevant
sections are below.  First, we instantiate the IMU component, with a custom configuration phase implementation where we
call setup for the component. Next, we instantiate the LinuxI2cDriver with a custom configuration phase to open the RPI
device path for I2C.

```fpp
module SystemReference {
  ...
  instance imu: Gnc.Imu base id 0x4C00 {
    phase Fpp.ToCpp.Phases.configComponents """
     imu.setup(Gnc::Imu::I2C_DEV0_ADDR);
     """
  }

  instance imuI2cBus: Drv.LinuxI2cDriver  base id 0x4D00 {
    phase Fpp.ToCpp.Phases.configComponents """
    if (!imuI2cBus.open("/dev/i2c-1")) {
         Fw::Logger::logMsg("[ERROR] Failed to open I2C device\\n");
    }
    """
  }
}
```

## Build and Test

Next we can test the system. First we need to perform a complete cross compilation build. Then we upload the binary to
our Raspberry PI and run it.

### Step 1: Cross-Compile

In this step we will set up a build cache specifically for building for raspberry pi. This is done using generate and
passing in the name of the desired toolchain file. Here we pass in `raspberrypi`.  Then we build passing in the same
named toolchain.

**In Docker**
```bash
cd /project/SystemReference
fprime-util generate raspberrypi
fprime-util build raspberrypi
```

### Step 2: Upload the Built Binary

The next step is to upload the binary file onto the Raspberry PI.  Output products are placed in the
`build-artifacts/<platform>` directory. In our case the binary is in `build-artifacts/raspberrypi/bin`. We can upload it
using ssh.

```bash
scp build-artifacts/raspberrypi/bin/SystemReference pi@<pi hostname>:SystemReference
```

**Note:** your team should have been provided the hostname and password for your pi. 

### Step 3: Running It!

To run it we need to do two things: launch the GDS and launch the binary on the PI. First, let us launch the GDS. This
is done with the `fprime-gds` command using the `-n` flag that prevents the GDS from also running the binary and we pass
in a dictionary, which was automatically built in the build step.

**Launching the GDS (In Docker)**
```bash
cd /project/SystemReference
fprime-gds -n --dictionary build-artifacts/raspberrypi/dict/SystemReferenceTopologyAppDictionary.xml
```

Next we run the binary and tell it to connect back to the running GDS. This is done from within the PI.

**Running the Binary**
```bash
pi@<pi hostname>
./SystemReference -a <ip of laptop> -p 50000
```

**Note:** you'll need to determine the IP address of the laptop on the network.
**Note:** you may need to open ports on your laptop, if you are running a firewall.  Make sure to open port `50000`.
