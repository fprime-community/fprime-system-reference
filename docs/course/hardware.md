# Hardware Setup

In order to complete the lab exercise we need to wire-up hardware. In this exercise we will be using the Raspberry PI 3
and the MPU-6050 IMU. The wiring can be completed according to the following guide.  Specifically, we need to wire the
MPU-6050 into the Raspberry PI's IMU bus (pin 3 and 5) as well as power and ground (pin 1 and 6).
